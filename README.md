# RecycleML
### The Pitch
- You are simply more likely to recycle if you have to think less to do so
- A huge problem with the recyclying industry is that when one piece of trash is in a recycling bin, the entire bin must be thrown out
- These two problems lead to the current failure of our recycling system and solving for this can spur true environmental progress

## Inspiration

- The feeling of uncertainty when you are faced with a bag of chips and an intimidating abundance of cans to decide from is why we created this app
- Rather than being forced to make an impulsive, and often incorrect, decision, we'd like to make the right decision for you.

## What it does

- User takes a picture of a disposal good and the application displays the most likely categories of recyclable or trash along with confidence values for each category

## How I built it

- Uses a Convolutional Neural Network to classify different types of waste based on a Kaggle dataset of thousands of images
- Hosted this web app on a Heroku server and connected this with an interactive UI

## Challenges I ran into

- Implementing Heroku and connecting our frontend to our AI backend were, without a doubt, the most difficult parts of this projects

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

- We are  proud of my neural network's ability to classify images into 6 different groups with such a high accuracy
- We are also very proud in our Heroku server and its ability to dynamically hold and conduct our AI operations to each of our images

## What I learned

- We learned about the many different ways to maximize the accuracy of a neural network
- We also learned how to host and upload images to a Heroku server

## What's next for RecycleML

- Integrating our software in hardware that can be installed near recyclying bins to make it extremely convinient to recycle
- Creating a mobile app so more people can actively classify different types of waste regardless of their vicinity to a recycle bin
